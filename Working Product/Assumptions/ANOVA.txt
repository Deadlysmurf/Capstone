The ANOVA test has important assumptions that must be satisfied in order for the associated p-value to be valid.

- The samples are independent.
- Each sample is from a normally distributed population.
- The population standard deviations of the groups are all equal. This property is known as homoscedasticity.

If these assumptions are not true for a given set of data, it may still be possible to use the Kruskal-Wallis H-test although with some loss of power.
