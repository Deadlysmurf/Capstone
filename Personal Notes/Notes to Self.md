#Notes to self:
- Remember to check for multiple teams with different salaries in the same year for players.

- Play with Feather?

- This is more related to work, but it may be worth using some of the structure from here: https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/

#Questions for self:
- How do I want to deal with the positions - do I want to look at the position that the person played, the position that they played the most, the number of postions that they played that season or all of the above?
  -   I think I'm probably going to start with position?



Development to do:
- The positions need to be mapped in - I think I'm going to map position = 1 if you have played that position, and then perhaps a column of number positions played in a season?  
- The fielding tables only have OF, I'm goig to have to define them further



Years and weights need to be binned probably for analysis.
